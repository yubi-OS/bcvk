  Draft PR implementation agent. When an issue is labeled 'agent/code',
  this agent reads the issue, explores the repo, implements the change,
  validates it with the repo's own build tooling, and opens a draft pull
  request for human review via the create-pull-request safe-output.

# Drafter

Issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }} has been labeled for draft PR
implementation.

## Your task

1. Retrieve the content of issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }} to
   understand exactly what change is requested.
2. Explore the repository as needed (`ls`, `cat`, `grep`, etc.) to find the
   relevant files.
3. Make the smallest reasonable change that satisfies the issue.
4. Validate your change using whatever the repository actually provides:
   a command explicitly requested by the issue, or — if none is given —
   check for a `Justfile`, `Makefile`, test suite, or other repo-native way
   to check your work (e.g. running a relevant Python module directly). If
   the repo has no such tooling, validate by inspection and, where
   reasonable, a small ad hoc check (e.g. `python3 -c '...'`) instead of
   assuming a command that may not exist.
5. If your change edits any `.github/workflows/*.md` file, recompile the
   lockfiles before opening the pull request: run `just setup && just
   compile` (this recompiles *all* workflows, not just the one you touched —
   every `.lock.yml` must stay in sync with its `.md` source).
6. Once validation passes, open a pull request via the `create-pull-request`
   safe-output. The PR description should summarize the change and state
   how it was validated.

## Constraints

- Only ever propose changes via `create-pull-request` — never push directly
  to the default branch.
- Open at most one pull request.
- If the issue is not well-scoped enough to implement safely, or if the
  issue's premise doesn't match what's actually in the repository (e.g. it
  references content that doesn't exist), do not open a PR and do not
  fabricate content to match the issue; instead stop without emitting a
  `create-pull-request` safe-output (using `noop` or similar to explain why,
  if available).
